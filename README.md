ðŸŒ± My name is Arsh Kadakia. I am a 3rd year student in the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto. I am majoring in the Machine Intelligence program, where I am learning in depth about machine learning and data science techologies.

ðŸ‘¯ In my spare time, you will find me learning and applying different full-stack technologies. I am currently working with a company, Mastermind Children's Academy, to build a responsive web application that is able to generate valuable consumer insights.

ðŸ”­ I am also a project director at U of T Machine Intelligence Student Team (UTMIST), where I led a group of 5 developers to build a consumer-friendly home-price predictor. You can check our work at [real-value.ca](http://www.realvalue.ca) (may take 2-3 minutes to load). 

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out and I will get back to you right away!
